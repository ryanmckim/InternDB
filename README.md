# InternDB

A platform for interns to share their internship experience anonymously.

As students who struggled to find internship information ourselves, we wanted to create a platform to allow users to leave anonymous reviews about companies regarding compensation, interview experience, and more details. The official launch is coming soon!

Built with React, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL.
